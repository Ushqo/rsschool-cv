### About Myself:

I chose the field of Frontend development, because, in my opinion, the IT sphere and Frontend development in particular is one of the flagship areas of technological development of mankind in the current time period. It is very tempting to think that you, albeit indirectly, but had a hand in the implementation of ideas that are at the peak of human thought. <br>

It is Frontend, in my opinion, that allows people located in different parts of the world to receive information in the form in which it is currently presented. The obvious visibility, the complex distribution of data, and the convenience of the user experience serve for me as the criteria why I chose this area of development in IT.<br>
